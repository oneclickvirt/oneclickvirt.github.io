# Introduction

There are two methods of building

## Setting Up Standalone

- Generate only one docker
- Can be configured to bind a separate IPV6 address, but requires a docker previously installed using the environment installation command of this set of scripts, and requires the host to be bound to at least the /112 IPV6 subnet
- Support for x86_64 and ARM architecture servers

### Download the Script

Command:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneclickvirt/docker/main/scripts/onedocker.sh -o onedocker.sh && chmod +x onedocker.sh
```

### Example

Running the supported variables are as follows

```
./onedocker.sh name cpu memory password sshport startport endport <independent_ipv6> <system> <disk>
```

Currently, the system only supports selecting:

- alpine
- debian
- ubuntu
- almalinux
- rockylinux
- openeuler

with Debian being the default choice.

The hard disk size can only be set by filling in the value if you have selected the option to support limiting the hard disk size during the previous Docker installation, it is not limited when not filled in by default.

```shell
./onedocker.sh test 1 512 123456 25000 34975 35000 N debian 5
```

The following is the information for the created example container:

| Attribute               | Value          |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Container Name         | test           |
| Username for SSH Login | root           |
| Password for SSH Login | 123456         |
| Number of CPU Cores    | 1              |
| Memory Size            | 512MB          |
| SSH Port               | 25000          |
| Port Range for Internal and External Mapping | 34975 to 35000   |
| Operating System       | debian         |
| Whether to bind a separate IPV6 address| N     |
| Disk Size              | 5G             |

### Related operations

Deleting the test container

```shell
docker rm -f test
rm -rf test
ls
```

Accessing the test container

```shell
docker exec -it test /bin/bash
```

To exit the container, simply execute ```exit```.

Inquiry Information

```shell
cat Container_Name(change me)
```

The output format is

```
Container_Name SSH_Port Root_Password Number_of_Cores Memory Start_of_Public_Port End_of_Public_Port
```

The docker's ipv6 address can only be looked up within the container itself, it doesn't exist in the docker's configuration

## Batch Deployment

- Run inheritance configuration generation multiple times in bulk.
- When generating multiple instances, it is recommended to execute within a `screen` session to avoid SSH connection interruptions.
- Support for x86_64 and ARM architecture servers

Command:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneclickvirt/docker/main/scripts/create_docker.sh -o create_docker.sh && chmod +x create_docker.sh && bash create_docker.sh
```

### Querying information on batch openings

```shell
cat dclog
```

The output format is

```
Container_Name SSH_Port Root_Password Number_of_Cores Memory Start_of_Public_Port End_of_Public_Port Disk_Size
```

One line corresponds to information about a container, the docker's ipv6 address can only be looked up within the container itself, it doesn't exist in the docker's configuration.

## Uninstall all Docker containers and images

The following command offload ignores ndpresponder to prevent IPV6 configuration failure

```shell
docker ps -a --format '{{.Names}}' | grep -vE '^ndpresponder' | xargs -r docker rm -f
docker images --format '{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}} {{.ID}}' | grep -v 'ndpresponder' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r docker rmi
rm -rf dclog test
ls
```

## Update all commands related to the above one-click scripts

Delete the original configuration script

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/ssh_sh.sh
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/ssh_bash.sh
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/check-dns.sh
rm -rf /root/ssh_sh.sh
rm -rf /root/ssh_bash.sh
rm -rf /root/onedocker.sh
rm -rf /root/create_docker.sh
```

Download back the relevant configuration scripts for the new version

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneclickvirt/docker/main/extra_scripts/check-dns.sh -O /usr/local/bin/check-dns.sh && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check-dns.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneclickvirt/docker/main/scripts/config.sh -O /usr/local/bin/config.sh && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/config.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneclickvirt/docker/main/scripts/ssh_bash.sh -O /usr/local/bin/ssh_bash.sh && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh_bash.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneclickvirt/docker/main/scripts/ssh_sh.sh -O /usr/local/bin/ssh_sh.sh && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh_sh.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneclickvirt/docker/main/scripts/onedocker.sh -O /root/onedocker.sh && chmod +x /root/onedocker.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneclickvirt/docker/main/scripts/create_docker.sh -O /root/create_docker.sh && chmod +x /root/create_docker.sh
```

## Start all containers after host reboot

The default containers are not set to restart themselves after stopping, you need to execute the following command to start all stopped containers.

```
docker start $(docker ps -aq)
```

## Start SSH service for all containers after host reboot

Since the container itself does not have a daemon, the SSH service cannot start itself, and you need to execute the following command to start the SSH process for all containers.

```
container_ids=$(docker ps -q)
for container_id in $container_ids
do
    docker exec -it $container_id bash -c "service ssh start"
    docker exec -it $container_id bash -c "service sshd restart"
    docker exec -it $container_id sh -c "service ssh start"
    docker exec -it $container_id sh -c "/usr/sbin/sshd"
done
```
